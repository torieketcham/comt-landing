This paper uses output from a three-dimensional numerical model to demonstrate that HV in Chesapeake Bay can be estimated well with as few as two vertical profiles. In addition, the cumulative hypoxic volume (HVC), i.e. the total amount of hypoxia in a given year, can be calculated with relatively low uncertainty (<10%) if continuous DO data are available from two strategically positioned vertical profiles. This is because HV in the Chesapeake Bay is strongly constrained by the geometry of the embayment. A simple Geometric HV calculation method is presented, and numerical model results are used to illustrate that for calculating HVC, the results using two daily-averaged profiles are typically more accurate than those of the standard method that interpolates bimonthly cruise data. Bimonthly data produce less accurate estimates of HVC because high frequency changes in oxygen concentration, for example due to regional-weather or storm-induced changes in wind direction and magnitude, are not resolved. The advantages of using continuous vertical profile data to estimate HVC should be applicable to other systems where hypoxic water is constrained to a specific area by bathymetry. The datasets below include the station file output from the Regional Ocean Modeling System Simple Respiration Model (ROMS-SRM) used in the analysis, as well as a MATLAB .mat file of the 3-D HV from the average files.</p><p><b>Collaborators: </b>Aaron Bever, Marjorie Friedrichs, Carl Friedrichs, Malcolm Scully</p><p><b>Publications: </b></p><a href=\"https://www.biogeosciences.net/13/2011/2016/\" target=\"_blank\">Bever, A.J., M.A.M.

Despite the simplicity of the approach, the model demonstrates skill in simulating the observed inter-annual variability of hypoxic volume capturing 50% of the observed variability in hypoxic volume (< 2 mg/L) for the month of July and 58% of the observed variability for the month of August, over the 30-year period.  Model skill increases throughout the summer suggesting that physical processes play a more important role in modulating hypoxia later in the summer.  Model skill is better for hypoxic volumes than for anoxic volumes.  In fact, a simple regression based on the integrated January—June Susquehanna River nitrogen load can explain more of the variability in the observed anoxic volumes than the 1-term model.  Model results suggest that the mean summer (June-August) wind speed is the single-most important physical variable contributing to variations in hypoxic volumes.</p><p><b>Collaborators: </b>Malcolm Scully</p><p><b>Publications: </b></p><p>Scully, M.E., 2016.

Although the mean nitrogen budget of the Chesapeake Bay has been previously estimated from observations, uncertainties associated with interannually varying hydrological conditions remain. In this study, a land-estuarine-ocean biogeochemical modeling system is developed to quantify Chesapeake riverine nitrogen inputs, within-estuary nitrogen transformation processes and the ultimate export of nitrogen to the coastal ocean. Model skill was evaluated using extensive in situ and satellite-derived data, and a simulation using environmental conditions for 2001–2005 was conducted to quantify the Chesapeake Bay nitrogen budget. The five year simulation was characterized by large riverine inputs of nitrogen split roughly 60:40 between inorganic:organic components. Much of this was denitrified and buried within the estuarine system. A positive net annual ecosystemproduction for the bay further contributed to a large advective export of organic nitrogen to the shelf and negligible inorganic nitrogen export. Interannual variability was strong, particularly for the riverine nitrogen fluxes. In years with higher than average riverine nitrogen  inputs, most of this excess nitrogen (50–60%) was exported from the bay as organic nitrogen, with the remaining split between burial, denitrification, and inorganic export to the coastal ocean. In comparison to previous simulations using generic shelf biogeochemical model formulations inside the estuary, the estuarine biogeochemical model described here produced more realistic and significantly greater exports of organic nitrogen and lower exports of inorganic nitrogen to the shelf.</p><p><b>Collaborators:</b></p><p><b>Publications:</b></p><p><b>Datasets:</b><div class=\"list-group\"></div></p></div>",
            "model_desc": "<h3>Primary Chesapeake Bay Testbed models:</h3><h4 class=\"sub-project-title\">ChesROMS-SRM, ChesROMS -ECB, ChesROMS-BGC</h4><p>ChesROMS (<a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12237-011-9423-5\" target=\"_blank\">Xu et al. 2012</a>) is a community ocean modeling system for the Chesapeake Bay region, which is based on the Regional Ocean Modeling System (<a href=\"http://www.myroms.org/\" target=\"_blank\">ROMS</a>), with significant adaptations for the Chesapeake Bay. The model uses a curvilinear horizontal grid and a stretched terrain-following vertical grid with twenty vertical layers. The model was developed to provide a community modeling system for hindcasts, nowcasts and forecasts of 3D hydrodynamic circulation, temperature and salinity.</p><p>Multiple ecosystem/biogeochemical models have been coupled with ChesROMS. These include the Simple Respiration Model (SRM) which uses a constant respiration rate throughout the water column, as well as more sophisticated biogeochemical including including <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015JG002931/epdf\" target=\"_blank\">ChesROMS-ECB</a> and ChesROMS-BGC (see <a href=\"http://www.biogeosciences.net/13/2011/2016/\" target=\"blank\">Irby et al. 2016</a> for descriptions of these models.)</p><h4 class=\"sub-project-title\">CBOFS-SRM</h4><p>The ROMS-based Chesapeake Bay Operational Forecast System (CBOFS; Lanerolle et al., 2011) is the operational model run by the NOAA National Ocean Service. A major difference between ChesROMS and CBOFS is the horizontal grid resolution; ChesROMS has 100x150 cells with about 1 to 7 km resolution; CBOFS has 332x291 cells with about 0.03 to 4 km resolution. Results from CBOFS are available at: <a href=\"https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/ofs/cbofs/cbofs.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/ofs/cbofs/cbofs.html</a>. The Simple Respiration Model (SRM) has recently been coupled with CBOFS; these results are only available on a developmental version of the official CBOFS website.</p><h3>Additional Chesapeake Bay models:</h3><h4 class=\"sub-project-title\">ROMS-RCA</h4><p>Another ROMS-based model for the Chesapeake Bay has been independently developed and coupled to the Row-Column AESOP model (RCA; Testa et al., 2014). This version of ROMS (Li et al. 2005) is very similar to ChesROMS (including a similar horizontal resolution and number of vertical grid levels), but has slightly different hydrodynamic parameterizations and physical forcing.</p><h4 class=\"sub-project-title\">CH3D-ICM</h4><p>The Curvilinear Hydrodynamics in Three Dimensions model (CH3D; Cerco et al., 2010), is compared with the ChesROMS models described above in Irby et al. (2016). This model employs a z-grid and is used by the EPA Chesapeake Bay Program as part of their regulatory operational modeling framework. The horizontal grid of CH3D-ICM has significantly greater resolution than ChesROMS, and is more equivalent to that of CBOFS. CH3D is coupled to the Integrated Compartment Model (ICM), which is a complex biogeochemical modeling system.</p><h4 class=\"sub-project-title\">EFDC-SRM</h4><p>The Hydrodynamic-Eutrophication Model – Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC) has been implemented for the Chesapeake Bay (Hong and Shen, 2012; Du and Shen, 2015), and also participated in the Chesapeake Bay Hypoxia Testbed comparison (Irby et al. 2016). The EFDC implementation used here is coupled to a version of the Simple Respiration Model (SRM).</p><h4 class=\"sub-project-title\">FVCOM-ICM</h4><p>The ChesROMS models were also compared with the Finite-Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM; Jiang and Xia, 2015). FVCOM employs an unstructured grid with ten vertical layers. Like CH3D, FVCOM is coupled to the ICM.</p>",

                "text": "<p>Hypoxia is a condition threatening the health of the Chesapeake Bay in which oxygen levels drop so low that fish and other animals are stressed or killed.  In the Bay, incidents of hypoxia-causing ‘dead zones’ are on the rise.</p><p>Hypoxia in Chesapeake Bay usually occurs in the summer and is primarily the result of human activities that deliver nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus into the Bay, although evidence from the testbed scientists suggest that wind forcing also plays a significant role. The added nutrients support surface blooms of algae, which eventually die, sink and are decomposed at the bottom of the Bay by oxygen-depleting bacteria. The resulting hypoxia can suffocate animals that cannot move away, such as shellfish, and — depending on how quickly the hypoxia develops — either kill or force into less suitable habitat free-swimming animals such as fish and crabs.</p><p>The Chesapeake Bay Testbed project is designed to provide a better understanding of the uncertainty inherent in predictions of properties such as salinity, temperature, chlorophyll, and nutrients; how this uncertainty contributes to the predictability of dissolved oxygen concentrations; and how to improve models of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in the Chesapeake Bay. Model intercomparisons have demonstrated that the regulatory model used by the EPA Chesapeake Bay Program performs as well as many of the research models currently being used by the scientific community, giving both Chesapeake Bay Program Managers and academic scientists more confidence in the regulatory model. An ensemble mean of multiple models was found to have higher skill predicting hypoxia than any individual model (<a href=\"http://www.biogeosciences.net/13/2011/2016/\" target=\"_blank\">Irby et al., 2016</a>), illustrating the potential value of multi-model ensembles for decision making in the Chesapeake Bay.</p><p>A simple one-term model for hypoxia was developed for use in operational forecasts and is currently providing nowcasts and 2-day forecasts of Chesapeake Bay hypoxia on the <a href=\"http://www.vims.edu/research/topics/dead_zones/forecasts/cbay/\" target=\"_blank\">Virginia Institute of Marine Science website</a>. Forecasts from more sophisticated hypoxia models are in the developmental stage and will soon also be available on this website, along with other fields relevant to Chesapeake stakeholders (temperature, salinity, chlorophyll, water clarity). Efforts to transition this tool to NOAA’s <a href=\"https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/ofs/cbofs/cbofs.html\" target=\"_blank\">Chesapeake Bay Operational Forecast System (CBOFS)</a> and to the <a href=\"http://oceansmap.maracoos.org/\" target=\"_blank\">IOOS Mid-Atlantic Regional Association (MARACOOS) OceansMap</a> are ongoing. In a companion effort, the Chesapeake Hypoxia Testbed team has used multiple models to examine how nutrient load reductions will impact dissolved oxygen in the Chesapeake Bay, and has developed a method for quantifying the uncertainty associated with projected changes in hypoxia resulting from the implementation of these nutrient reductions. Ongoing work is focused on applying projected changes in temperature, freshwater flow, and sea level rise for a 2050 scenario to explore the impact climate change may have on future Chesapeake Bay hypoxia and the potential success of the nutrient reductions in attaining mandated estuarine water quality standards.</p><p>The results of this project are providing the modeling information that will enable best management practices and mitigation measures to be targeted on the human activities that have the most significant effect on decreasing nutrient transfer from land to coastal ecosystems in the region. Recent findings include (1) that the ChesROMS-1term model performs just as well when using nowcast forcing as it does when using hindcast forcing, (2) that ignoring precipitation/evaporation and underestimating riverine freshwater inputs may be causing a high salinity bias in the official version of CBOFS, (3) that nutrient load reduction scenarios conducted with both the regulatory EPA model and our ChesROMS-BGC research model confirm that both models predict similar improvements in bottom DO, and nearly identical water quality standards attainment, (4) the transition of the HYPOXIA_SRM (simple respiration model) to the official ROMS Ecosystem Branch.

The formation is due to decay of organic matter that is primarily derived from nutrient inputs from the Mississippi/Atchafalaya river system. Efforts are underway to reduce the extent of hypoxic conditions through nutrient management in the watershed; for example, the interagency <a href='https://www.epa.gov/ms-htf' target='_blank'>Hypoxia Task Force</a> is developing Action Plans with input from various stakeholders that set out targets for hypoxia reduction. In order to improve mechanistic understanding of hypoxia formation and to inform nutrient management decisions, several coupled circulation-hypoxia models are being developed for the Mississippi River outflow region.</p><p>This COMT project conducts an inter-comparison of these hypoxia models and uses scenario simulations to assess the impact of potential reductions in nutrient load and of climate change on hypoxia formation. Understanding how and why model predictions differ will ultimately lead to improved model formulations, improved hindcasts and forecasts, and improved mechanistic understanding. The study is focusing on identifying factors that influence the prediction of dissolved oxygen concentration both to improve our understanding of the controlling processes and to provide guidance on the eventual implementation of dissolved oxygen forecasts in NOAA’s Northern Gulf of Mexico Operational Forecast System (NGOFS).</p><video class='img-responsive img-thumbnail' controls='controls'><source src='http://memg.ocean.dal.ca/fennelk/wip/COMT_2016_hindcast/movies/CrossSec_3d_ROMS_NARR_2015.mp4' type='video/mp4'></video><p class='caption'>Simulated surface salinity and bottom water oxygen concentration in 2015 in the small ROMS domain.</p><video class='img-responsive img-thumbnail' controls='controls'><source src='http://memg.ocean.dal.ca/fennelk/wip/COMT_2016_hindcast/movies/CrossSec_3d_ROMS_NARR_2016.mp4' type='video/mp4'></video><p class='caption'>Simulated surface salinity and bottom water oxygen concentration in 2016 in the small ROMS domain.</p>"

Summer 2009. No data assimilation. Hourly model outputs.</p><h3>A coupled physical/biogeochemical WCOFS model test</h3><p>Three NPZ-type, lower trophic level, biogeochemical models were evaluated and compared as part of this project. (1) The Cascadia model is a six-component model including nutrients, phytoplankton, microzooplankton, slow- and fast-sinking detritus, and oxygen.  It has been developed and parameterized specifically for Washington-Oregon coastal waters, and is run in near real-time at the University of Washington.  (2) The UCSC version of NEMURO (derived from Kishi et al. 2007) includes eleven state variables: nitrate, ammonium, small and large phytoplankton biomass, small, large and predatory zooplankton biomass, particulate and dissolved organic nitrogen, particulate silica, and silicic acid concentration.  NEMURO has been used for years in the regional domain and is run at UCSC in near real-time with data assimilation in support of CeNCOOS.   (3) The CoSiNE model (Chai et al., 2002) is a 9-component model, representing the evolution of two phytoplankton groups, two size classes of zooplankton, two types of detritus, ammonium, nitrate, and silicate.  It has been widely applied to a variety of regions including the tropical Pacific ocean and California current system.</p><p>For the biogeochemical comparison, a 1-year integration was carried out for the year 2000.  Model fields were evaluated by calculating model data misfit to instantaneous surface chlorophyll data from the SeaWiFS platform and deviations from climatological nutrients after spatially and temporally averaging model output over three-month, 1-degree square regions.  Models were evaluated both using base parameters tuned for alternate applications and parameters optimized for this physical implementation resulting from a Monte Carlo tuning procedure (Mattern and Edwards, 2017).  Overall, all three models performed well in the UCSC domain with good agreement with data.  Phytoplankton growth rates and zooplankton grazing rates for each model spanned ranges for these rate processes calculated in along the Oregon and Washington coasts (Banas et al., 2008).  Cascadia was the most computationally efficient model with the fewest state variables.  The model having lowest cost function (least model-data misfit) was the most complex model investigated, NEMURO.</p><p>Based on results of the multi-model evaluation in the regional CCS domain, the NEMURO model was ported to the 4 km WCOFS domain and integrated as a test-case from October 1, 2012, to December 31, 2013.  Model output was evaluated against satellite-derived surface chlorophyll and climatological nitrate and silicate over the spring/summer period of 2013.  The model performs well, revealing good quantifiable agreement with observations in terms of mean quantities and temporal evolution.  Model results from this experiment, along with all necessary forcing files, are posted here as a baseline against which future results can be compared and improvements established.</p><p><b>References: </b></p><p>Banas NS, Lessard E, Kudela R, MacCready P, Peterson T, Hickey BM, Frame E (2009) Planktonic growth and grazing in the Columbia River plume region: A biophysical model study.

It provides daily updates of 3-day forecasts of oceanic currents, temperature, salinity and total sea level. The system operation is part of the NANOOS Regional Association activities and forecasts are delivered to the public at http://nvs.nanoos.org. The model resolution is 2-km in horizontal. The domain extends in the alongshore direction from 40.5 to 50N. The model dynamics are based on the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS, myroms.org). The initial conditions for the forecasts are constrained by assimilation of alongtrack altimetry, satellite SST, and HF radar surface currents. Data assimilation uses the 4DVAR method in a series of 3-day windows. To enable 4DVAR, the nonlinear ROMS is integrated with the AVRORA tangent linear and adjoint system (Kurapov et al., JGR, 2011).</p><p>Over the years, S. Erofeeva, P. Yu, I. Pasmans and A.

The model <a href=\"http://faculty.washington.edu/pmacc/LO/LiveOcean.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://faculty.washington.edu/pmacc/LO/LiveOcean.html</a> creates a three-day forecast every day for the region shown in Fig. 1.  The model domain covers 43 to 50 N and -127.4 to -122 W.  The LiveOcean output database contains continuous hourly fields starting January 1, 2013 and going to the present.  Recent fields, including biogeochemical properties on multiple levels, are available publicly through the NANOOS NVS website <a href=\"http://nvs.nanoos.org/Explorer?action=overlay:liveocean_temp</\" target=\"_blank\">http://nvs.nanoos.org/Explorer?action=overlay:liveocean_temp</a> and the IOOS EDS Model Viewer <a href=\"https://eds.ioos.us/\" target=\"_blank\">https://eds.ioos.us/.</a></p><p>The modeling framework employs the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS http://myroms.org/) a free surface, hydrostatic, primitive equation model.  The model is forced with realistic atmospheric, tide, river, and ocean boundary conditions to simulate the 3D circulation and water properties throughout the domain.  The model includes 16 river point sources using daily measured and forecast discharge including 14 Puget Sound rivers, the Fraser River, and the Columbia River.  Eight tidal constituents derived from the 1/4° TPXO7.2 inverse global tidal model are forced at the open boundaries. Meteorological forcing of surface pressure, wind, air temperature, relative humidity, shortwave radiation, downward longwave radiation, and rainfall are taken from a WRF regional forecast model with 12 km resolution run by Dr. Cliff Mass at University of Washington. Open ocean boundary conditions for daily-averaged velocity, salinity, temperature and sea surface height come from the HYCOM global model (<a href=\"http://hycom.org/\" target=\"_blank\">http://hycom.org/</a>). The river, atmosphere and ocean forcing models are data-assimilative and so do an excellent job of keeping their forecast fields close to observations.  The grid horizontal resolution is 1.5 km on the shelf, and 4.5 km far offshore.  There are 40 vertical levels, distributed from the sea floor to the sea surface, giving excellent resolution of both bottom and near-surface processes.  The large domain allows important interactions between the inland and coastal waters, for example the influence of coastal upwelling and the Columbia River plume on the inflow to the Strait of Juan de Fuca, which in turn sets many of the water properties in Puget Sound.</p><p>This model was developed in the recent NOAA-funded PNWTOX project (Dr. Barbara Hickey, PI) to study Pseudo-nitzschia harmful algal blooms (HABs).  Hindcast experiments from 2004-2007 were extensively validated in terms of currents, temperature, salinity, sea surface height, and biogeochemistry (Giddings et al. 2014; Davis et al. 2014; Siedlecki et al. 2015).  The model exhibited significant skill in all regions on the shelf.  Most recently it has been used in a study of the Strait of Juan de Fuca (Giddings and MacCready 2017) where it was successfully able to reproduce the flow reversals there which are caused by downwelling-favorable winds and the Columbia River plume.  Over the past three years, with funding from the Washington Ocean Acidification Center, the model framework was transitioned from being a hindcast model to its current version as a daily forecast model.  The model is currently used as part of the NOAA MERHAB-PNW project to provide early warning of the arrival of HABs at the Washington coast.</p><p>Model development team: Parker MacCready (UW), Ryan McCabe (UW), Samantha Siedlecki (U.

The ocean circulation is modeled using the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS). Our domain extends from midway down the Baja Peninsula to 48 N, near the southern tip of Vancouver Island, at 1/10 degree (roughly 10 km) resolution, with 42 terrain-following levels resolving vertical structure in ocean properties. The model is forced at the surface by atmospheric fields produced by the Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS) which is run in near-real-time by the Naval Research Laboratory. Oceanic fields at the lateral boundaries are obtained from a larger, basin-scale data assimilative model, HYCOM. The model does not include freshwater forcing by rivers, and it neglects tidal motion.</p><p>This model has provided the baseline configuration for many studies of ocean dynamics (Veneziani et al. 2009b), biogeochemical interactions (Goebel et al. 2010), larval dispersal (Drake et al., 2011), and physical data assimilation (Broquet et al., 2010, Moore et al., 2013, Neveu et al., 2016), and coupled biophysical data assimilation (Song et al. 2016, Mattern et al. 2017).   </p><p>The UCSC ocean data assimilation methodology uses the ROMS 4-Dimensional Variational assimilation system (Moore et al., 2011).  Satellite-derived sea surface height, sea surface temperature, and sea surface salinity are assimilated when available, along with in-situ hydrography from a variety of sources (e.g., shipboard casts, gliders, and \nArgo profiles).  Sequences of 8-day analyses of the California Current System from 1980 to 2010 and 1999 to 2011 have been calculated, and a near real-time product has been running fairly routinely from 2011 to the present.  A near real-time, coupled physical biogeochemical model has also been running since 2014, using 4-day cycles and assimilating satellite-derived chlorophyll estimates.</p><p>Considerably more information about the model and its output can be found at <a href=\"http://oceanmodeling.ucsc.edu\" target=\"_blank\">http://oceanmodeling.ucsc.edu.</a></p><p><b>References: </b></p><p>Broquet, G., A.

Broad project objectives are to: (1) compile a data set of observations collected around Puerto Rico and the USVI by the IOOS Caribbean Regional Association; (2) evaluate multiple, coupled wave/surge/inundation models against this data; (3) recommend the most suitable model for transition to operations and (4) assist with the transition. These outcomes will also be applicable to U.S. island regions in the Pacific and may therefore guide future implementations at NOAA’s Central Pacific Hurricane Center.</p><p>U.S. island regions in the Caribbean and Pacific pose many challenges to the accurate modeling and prediction of hazardous wave-dominated storm surge inundation events. The relative importance of physical processes leading to inundation in steep-sloped, reef-edged island environments differs from those in milder-sloped mainland environments. Relatively little research has been done in these environments, constituting a significant knowledge gap. To compound this uncertainty, little observational data are available in many island environments. As a result, the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) currently lacks operational surge and inundation guidance for these regions. An exception to this general data scarcity is Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI), which frequently experience strong tropical and extra-tropical storms resulting in high waves, storm surge, and river flooding. A large number of observational instruments have been deployed here, many by IOOS Caribbean Regional Association partners, creating a valuable resource for the evaluation and advancement of operational wave/surge/inundation models of these areas.</p><p>Three teams – an operational assessment team (federal user group), a numerical modeling team and a data management team – will work together to understand the driving processes of sea level variability in deep ocean island geographies, understand the robustness and accuracy of a variety of wind products, and to discern the ability to forecast tides, storm events and intra-annual variability.</p><p>Specifically in the wake of Hurricanes Irma and Maria in September of 2017, detailed hindcasts were performed of these storm events using a high fidelity research grade ADCIRC+SWAN model of the Caribbean and Puerto Rico / U.S. Virgin Islands (PR/USVI), NOAA’s ADCIRC-driven HSOFS operational mesh, and NOAA NHC’s SLOSH using the latest PR/USVI grid. Furthermore, the impact of baroclinic processes on intra-annual and storm driven sea level variability is evaluated. The results from these studies are described in a sequence of two Journal of Geophysical Research papers (REF here; in review).</p><p>In addition, two sets of ancillary simulation sets were also developed as a result of the work and developments made in this project. The first are detailed analyses and hindcasts of Hurricanes Georges (1998) and Irene (2011). Unfortunately, the lack of highly reliable hindcast winds and/or water level data for these storms did not make for sufficiently reliable hindcasts to draw conclusions about the storm physics and/or model inter-comparisons. In addition, a statistical response probability set was developed with the SLOSH PR/USVI model.</p>"

Wave-current interaction created variations in the surge elevation in both space and time, with the more significant effects occurring over the shelf and open coast rather than inside the inner bays. Sea level change along the coast was mainly driven by barotropic dynamics; the highest vertically integrated water transports were essentially the same for cases with and without vertical stratification. However, wave-current interaction generated strong vertical current shear in some of the stratified areas, leading to a strong offshore transport near the bottom and vertical turbulent mixing over the continental shelf. Stratification could also result in a significant difference in current velocities around islands where the water is not vertically well-mixed.</p><p><b>Publications: </b>Yunfang Sun, Changsheng Chen, Robert C.

All three models showed comparable tidal accuracy and consistent dynamic responses to storm winds, both with and without the inclusion of wave effects. The three models also showed that wave-current interaction could (1) change the current direction on the shelf to the north of Scituate Harbor from along-shelf to onshore, thereby enlarging onshore water transport and (2) intensify an anticyclonic eddy in the harbor entrance and a cyclonic eddy in the harbor interior, which could push water inside the harbor toward the northern peninsula and the southern end and thus enhance flooding in those areas.</p><p><b>Publications: </b>Changsheng Chen, Robert C.

In all simulations, a wind driven coastal current flowed southward across the harbor entrance, with an attached separation eddy forming downstream of the northern breakwater and a rapid decrease of wave energy entering the harbor. With wave-current interaction, the southward coastal current was strongly enhanced and currents within the separation eddy increased to more than 1 m/s, making it highly nonlinear with large lateral shears. Comparisons of the model water elevation time series with harbor tide station measurements showed that wave-current interaction increased the peak model surge by ∼8 cm, in closer agreement with the observed peak.

The default/recommended setting for the wind input parameterization overestimated the maximum significant wave heights by about 2 m in the deep Gulf of Mexico when compared with observations from moorings. The overestimation could be relieved either by adjusting the maximum value of the surface drag coefficient or by substituting a high-wind-speed bulk formula for the default low-to-moderate one used in SWAN. Because of the dissipative effects of the shallow coastal areas, the overestimation of waves in deep water has limited impact on the waves in near-shore waters. Thus, previous wave model results using a low-to-moderate wind speed bulk formula may still be reliable in waters shallower than 20 m while overestimating significant wave heights in deeper waters for high wind speed conditions such as hurricanes.</p><p><b>Publications: </b>Huang, Y., R.H.

However, its large wind field in conjunction with the broad Louisiana-Texas shelf and large-scale concave coastal geometry generated waves and surge that impacted over 1000 km of coastline. Ike's complex and varied wave and surge response included: the development of a storm surge “forerunner” 24 h prior to the storm's landfall due to strong shore-parallel, wind-driven currents and the associated across-shelf, geostrophic setup; the resulting early rise of water in coastal bays and lakes facilitating inland surge penetration and inundation; the shore-normal wind-driven peak surge; the southward propagation of a free wave along the Texas shelf; and the appearance of resonant and reflected waves on the adjacent continental shelf. Preexisting and rapidly deployed instrumentation provided the most comprehensive hurricane response data set ever recorded. More than 91 wave parameter time histories, 523 water level time histories, and 206 high water marks were collected in deep water, in the near shore, and up to 65km inland.

Grid resolution requirements were found to be less stringent in the open ocean, however, coarse resolution or the absence of intratidal zones decreased solution accuracy along protected near shore and inland coastal areas due to decreased frictional attenuation. Diurnal tidal amplitudes were more sensitive to the presence of intratidal zones and coarse mesh resolution than semidiurnal tides. The bottom friction parameterization had little effect on tidal skill, however, it had a significant impact on the strength of the alongshore current generated during hurricane Ike and the magnitude of the resulting geostrophic setup (forerunner). Nonlinear advection increased the geostrophic set up by 15–20 cm and increased resonant shelf waves by 20–30 cm.

In addition, NWS's official operational forecast storm surge model, SLOSH, was used on both local (Galveston and Sabine Pass basins) and Gulf of Mexico (ETSS) grids. The three unstructured models yielded similar results for both hurricanes. These models all appeared to reproduce the important physical processes, showed minimal water level or wave height bias, and comparable variances versus observations. SLOSH using the Galveston Basin grid failed to capture the hurricane Ike forerunner and was therefore biased significantly low. SLOSH performed better on the Sabine Pass Basin grid for hurricane Rita, which did not elicit a significant forerunner. SLOSH on the ETSS grid showed minimal bias for either storm, although its accuracy was limited by the nearly 5 km resolution in near shore/onshore areas. In all cases, SLOSH deviations from observations were greater than those from the three unstructured grid models. The largest difference in model performance was observed in execution speed and scalability. The implicit time stepping scheme of SELFE+WWM performed well at small numbers of cores, but scaled poorly at larger numbers of cores. ADCIRC+SWAN had better scaling and absolute performance when more than 128 cores were used per run. SLOSH is not configured to utilize modern parallel computing architecture and rather is limited to running on a single core. Runtimes for ADCIRC on a single core were more than 10 times longer than for SLOSH on the ETSS grid, even after the SLOSH runtimes were normalize for the number of grid nodes. Thus, SLOSH remains more efficient for use in probabilistic forecasting based on large ensembles of model runs. However, SLOSH-based probabilistic forecasts should be assessed for accuracy (particularly high or low bias) by comparing select, individual SLOSH runs with similar runs using higher resolution unstructured grid models as presented herein.</p><p><b>Publications: </b>Kerr, P.

It has been highly parallelized using domain decomposition for efficient application on high performance computers (Dietrich et al, 2012). Following Hurricane Katrina (2005), ADCIRC was coupled with the unstructured grid version of the SWAN wave model (Ziljema, 2010) to create a modeling system often called ADCIRC+SWAN (or often just ADCIRC) that provides a seamless solution to tides, surge and waves (Bunya et al, 2010; Dietrich et al, 2010; Dietrich et al, 2011). ADCIRC has also been coupled to the US Army Corps of Engineers ST-WAVE model via the Coastal Storm Modeling System (CSTORM-MS, Massey et al, 2011) and is currently being coupling to the unstructured version of its WaveWatch III wave model (A. van der Westhuysen, NOAA NWS/EMC personal communication). ADCIRC has been used to provide surge and wave conditions to delineate coastal flood hazards for the FEMA National Flood Insurance Program from New England to Texas, to evaluate flood hazards at coastal nuclear power plants for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, to design coastal flood reduction systems (e.g., levees, flood walls) around major coastal cities including New Orleans (USACE, 2012), Houston/Galveston and New York City (Bloomberg, 2013). It is one of NOAA’s core coastal models and is the basis of NOAA’s V-DATUM program as well as the ESTOFS and HSOFS operational models. A previous pilot project associated with NOAA’s CI-Flow program demonstrated that output from NOAA’s Distributed Hydrology Model (HL-RDHM) could be used as a real time input to ADCIRC in eastern North Carolina (Van Cooten et al, 2011; Dresback et al, 2013) although the ADCIRC triangular grids restricted the allowable model time step and therefore the effectiveness of the application. By overcoming this limitation, ADCIRC may be an attractive hydrodynamic solution in the Middle Zone since it would simply be an extension of (and thus seamlessly integrate with) the operational ESTOFS / HSOFS models.</p><h3>D-Flow:</h3><p>NOAA’s Office of Water Prediction has recently begun working with the D-Flow Flexible Mesh (FM) model (H. Mashriqui, NOAA OWP, personal communication). D-Flow is the hydrodynamic component of the DELFT-3D hydro-morphological modeling suite used to simulate non-steady flows and transport in 1D, 2D or 3D, (Deltares, 2014). Forcing includes tides meteorological fields and rivers, and it simulates the wetting and drying for flooding computations. The original D-Flow solves the shallow water equations on either a rectilinear or curvilinear, boundary fitted mesh while the more recently developed D-Flow FM uses an unstructured, flexible mesh of triangles, quadrilaterals and / or hexagons. D-Flow FM has a finite volume numerical algorithm with a higher-order advection treatment that is better suited for advection dominated supercritical flows, bores and dam breaks than ADCIRC’s finite element algorithm. D-Flow FM is parallelized for high performance computing, using a domain decomposition approach similar to ADCIRC and using OpenMP. D-Flow FM may therefore be an attractive option in the Middle Zone provided an effective coupling can be developed with ESTOFS / HSOFS. The overall DELFT-3D package has been widely applied in coastal, river and estuarine areas for water flows sediment transport, waves, water quality, morphological developments and ecology. In 2011, the D-Flow curvilinear grid model was open-sourced. D-Flow FM is currently limited to a small group of development partners, but Deltares anticipates having D-Flow FM fully open source in late 2018. Given that NOAA is already using 2 D-Flow FM, the actual open source release date should not constrain its use in this COMT project.</p><h3>GSSHA:</h3><p>GSSHA (Gridded Surface/Subsurface Hydrologic Analysis - Downer and Ogden, 2004) is a two-dimensional, physically-based watershed model that simulates surface water and groundwater hydrology, erosion and sediment transport. It has been developed at the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center Hydraulic Modeling Branch and is approved for use for determining hazards from hydrologic flooding for the FEMA National Flood Insurance Program. GSSHA solves the diffusive wave approximation to the shallow water equations, that neglects transient terms in the momentum equation. A finite volume numerical solver is used on a regular square grid spatial discretization of the watershed with elevation data extracted from a digital elevation model. GSSHA can represent various hydraulic structures such as weirs, culverts, detention basins, etc, and includes a vector channel algorithm allowing channels to flow in any direction independent from the grid resolution. GSSHA models a large number of processes including precipitation distribution, snowfall accumulation and melting, infiltration, evapotranspiration, surface runoff routing, channel flow routing, unsaturated zone flow, saturated groundwater flow, overland sediment erosion, transport and deposition, and channel routing of sediments. GSSHA provides the capability to explicitly model precipitation input and hydrologic processes in the Middle Zone, versus simply routing water from the Upland or Coastal Zone across the Middle Zone by ADCIRC and D-Flow. Due to the low slope topography along much of the US coast (particularly the Gulf and SE Atlantic coasts) the width of the Middle Zone may be significant, and therefore including hydrologic processes in this zone may be important. On the other hand, the use of the diffusive wave approximation in rivers subject to tidal influence and upstream surge propagation is probably not adequate, thereby requiring a combination of ADCIRC / D-FLOW and GSSHA in the Middle Zone. Including GSSHA in this COMT project provides the opportunity to determine the data flows required to include GSSHA or a similar model of the Middle Zone hydrology and evaluate its value for inclusion as part of the Middle Zone solution.</p><h4>References</h4><p><a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/html/sirr/html/report/report.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg, M.

            "model_desc": "<h3>NECOFS:</h3><p>NECOFS is an integrated regional atmosphere/surface wave/ocean forecast model system, covering the Delaware Shelf to the eastern end of the Scotian Shelf. NERACOOS and IOOS have supported the operations and improvement of NECOFS since 2007. The present system includes: 1) a community mesoscale meteorological model, Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF); 2) the 4th regional version of the Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (GOM4-FVCOM); 3) the unstructured-grid surface wave model (GOM4-SWAVE) modified from SWAN (Qi et al., 2009); 4) the Massachusetts (Mass) Coastal FVCOM with the inclusion of estuaries, inlets, harbors and intertidal wetlands; and 5) four subdomain wave-current coupled FVCOM inundation forecast systems in Scituate and Boston Harbor, MA; Hampton-Seabrook Estuary, NH, and Saco Bay, ME (Figure 1).</p><img class='img-responsive img-thumbnail' src='/images/comt/necofs.png' /><p class='caption'>Figure 1. Schematic chart of the NERACOOS supported Northeast Coastal Ocean Forecast System (NECOFS).</p><p>NECOFS is forced by 1) the surface wind, wind stress, heat flux and precipitation minus evaporation flux; 2) measured river discharge along the coastal boundary; 3) surface waves and tides along the ocean boundary; 4) the inflow of the cool and lower salinity water from the upstream Scotian Shelf; and 5) along the outer ocean boundary by the Global-FVCOM, which allows the interaction with the Gulf Stream as well as data assimilation of SST, SSH and T/S profiles for the NECOFS domain covering the entire Northeast coastal region.</p><p>As an initial component of a state-of-the art “end-to-end” model forecast system for NERACOOS, NECOFS was placed in experimental forecast operation in late 2007, making daily experimental three-day forecast of surface winds, air pressure, precipitation via evaporation, wintertime icing, water elevation, 3-D water currents, water temperature and salinity, significant wave height/frequency, and storm-induced coastal inundation for the Northeast US coastal region. The forecast operation was carried out daily with an updated initial condition that is determined by the three-day backward hindcast or nowcast data assimilation. The data used in the data assimilation includes satellite SST and radiation, river discharge, NOAA C-MAN and NDBC buoys, and NERACOOS buoys. A web-based mapping application was developed to display the NECOFS forecast products (via WMS services) for public use, which can be accessed at the address: http://134.88.228.119:8080/fvcomwms/. Additionally, NECOFS data are accessible via web services from a THREDDS Data Server (TDS) housed at University of Massachusetts – Dartmouth (UMassD) and integrated into several NERACOOS.org data products, including a model/observation comparison tool and a recently developed coastal flood forecast tool.</p><p>The present version of NECOFS has two versions: 1) forecast version, and 2) hindcast version. Both forecast and hindcast versions use the same regional domain grid, but the forecast version does not include the nesting boundary with global models and has a maximum water depth of 1500 m. The hindcast version is a global-regional nested system with the boundary conditions provided by Global-FVCOM.</p><p>Hindcasts produced by NECOFS successfully capture the spatial and temporal variability of the physical field in the region including: vertical mixing and subtidal currents (Cowles et al., 2008); tidal elevations/currents (Chen et al., 2011); water stratification (Li et al., 2015); CODAR-derived surface currents (Sun et al., 2016); and the upstream region in the Arctic Ocean (Chen et al. 2016, Zhang et al., 2016a,b).</p><p>The current NECOFS system is at a Readiness Level (RL) of 7, since it has been demonstrated in an operational environment. This project will advance NECOFS to a RL of 9 for the Northeast Region. However, one of the main focus areas of this project is to upgrade various components of NECOFS that are currently at a RL of 4-5 to a RL of 7-8. The Finite Volume Community Ocean Model Community (FVCOM), at the core of NECOFS, has been developed and upgraded by the UMassD team since 1999 (Chen et al., 2003, 2006, 2013). It features unstructured triangular meshes with horizontal resolution of ~ 0.1-25 km and a hybrid terrain-following vertical coordinates. The most recent version of FVCOM (version-4) is a fully coupled current-ice-wave-sediment-ecosystem model system. FVCOM version-5 is in development and currently at a RL of 5, since it has undergone successful evaluation in a relevant environment. This project will advance FVCOM version-5 to a RL of 8.</p><p>Global-FVCOM is a fully atmosphere-ice-surface wave-ocean coupled primitive equation unstructured-grid ocean model that was also developed by UMassD. Global FVCOM is driven by astronomical tidal forcing with eight constituents (M2, S2, N2, K2, K1, P1, O1 and Q1); surface wind stress; net heat flux at the surface plus shortwave irradiance in the water column; surface air pressure gradients; precipitation (P) minus evaporation (E); and river discharge (Gao et al., 2011, Chen et al., 2016). The updated version of Global-FVCOM features a horizontal resolution of ~2 km (measured by the length of the longest edge of a triangular cell) within the Canadian Archipelago, shelf-break and coastal regions to ~50 km in the interior open ocean. The vertical grid features a total of 45 layers (Chen et al., 2009, 2016). In shelf and coastal regions of depth less than 225 m, a sigma distribution with a uniform layer thickness is used. The coordinate transition thus occurs smoothly at a depth of 225 m, where all layers have a uniform thickness of 5 m.</p><h3>The Advanced Research Weather Research Forecast model (ARW-WRF):</h3><p>With support from the NOAA Cooperative Institute for the North Atlantic Region, in the wake of the Sandy Superstorm, the present version of NECOFS was used to examine the influence of oceanic mixed layer (OML) dynamics, cumulus parameterization, atmospheric planetary boundary layer schemes, grid design/resolution on intensity, pathway and landfall of Hurricane Sandy (Li et al., 2017). Including the OML parameterization was shown to significantly improve the accuracy of the simulated hurricane pathway and the intensity of the minimum central sea level pressure. OML parameterization was included in NECOFS through coupling the Advanced Research Weather Forecast model (ARW-WRF) into NECOFS and conducting the hurricane simulation for the cases with and without coupling of the OML. The reality and accuracy of hurricane path and intensity were also found to be relevant to the design and resolution of the two-way nested grid. To improve the NECOFS’ capability for hurricane forecast and storm induced coastal inundation, it is necessary to upgrade the NECOFS into a fully coupled atmospheric-oceanic model system. Improving the domain covering the region of the early development stage of the hurricane and grid refinement in the coastal region could also improve the simulation results of hurricane center pathway, timing and intensity. The NECOFS with the AWR-WRF has undergone successful evaluation in an experimental environment and is at a RL of 4.</p><h3>Extended and higher Resolution Domain - GOM5-FVCOM</h3><p>An expanded and higher resolution grid domain, GOM5-FVCOM, has been developed with a southward extended domain to Cape Hatteras. The new grid domain will improve the ability to investigate coastal inundation, as well as provide an increased understanding of changes in the connectivity of the fish larvae recruitment, coastal acidification, and ecosystems over the entire Northeast coastal ocean. The GOM5-FVCOM domain has undergone successful evaluation in relevant environment through testing and prototyping and is at a RL of 5.</p><h4>References</h4><p>Chen, C., H. Liu, and R.

                "text": "<p>In the last decade, IOOS has made remarkable progress toward an interoperable framework for working with ocean forecast model data. Providers deliver data via community standard OPeNDAP services using Climate and Forecast (CF) metadata conventions, and developers then use standard libraries to build applications that will work with any structured grid model (e.g. ROMS, NCOM, HYCOM, Delft3D) without the need to write any model-specific code. An outstanding gap, however, is the ability to fully support unstructured grid (e.g. triangular mesh) models, which are now being used throughout IOOS for both inundation and full 3D operational ocean forecasts.</p><p>The need for better tools to work with unstructured grids has been apparent for some time: In 2006, NOAA and NSF co-sponsored a workshop, “Community Standards for Unstructured Grids,” which was attended by 30 representatives from academic, government, and commercial organizations. The consensus statement of the workshop was “The unstructured ocean model community should define a data model (in the language of OPeNDAP) and ensure the mapping of that model onto netCDF3 and HDF5 is functional”. The community subsequently developed the <a href=\"http://ugrid-conventions.github.io/ugrid-conventions/\" target=\"_blank\">UGRID Conventions</a>, which extend the CF metadata conventions to describe unstructured grid model output. It remains to embed these standards into the services most commonly used by the IOOS community.</p><p>While IOOS-supported services can be delivered and consumed by a variety of software components, Unidata’s THREDDS Data Server (TDS) is the most widely used in IOOS. The TDS not only provides OPeNDAP access, but provides the OGC Web Map Service to create maps and NetCDF Subset Service to extract datasets based on longitude/latitude and calendar date extents. The Unidata NetCDF-Java library, which underlies the TDS, also supports many client applications (e.g. Unidata IDV, Matlab NCTOOLBOX, University of Reading NcWMS, NASA Panoply).</p><p>IOOS COMT 1.0 supported the development of the UGRID Conventions and the development of pilot UGRID-compliant tools, such as the pyugrid python library and the prototype ugrid branch of the NCTOOLBOX Matlab toolbox. The NCTOOLBOX work showed the promise of supporting UGRID in NetCDF-Java, enabling interoperable access to water level predictions -- a strong focus in COMT 1.0. The code was not integrated into the Unidata code base, however, and significant technical and code development (with documentation, testing, support) are still needed to bring unstructured grid models to the same level of functionality as structured grid models.</p><p>We propose to build on the success of this framework and these proof-of-concept demonstrations, extending the NetCDF-Java library to allow unstructured grid models to be “first-class citizens” in the Unidata software stack. While Unidata developers have long been interested in developing these capabilities, Unidata is primarily driven by the needs of atmospheric forecast model users. Unidata’s technical expertise as developers of the THREDDS technologies, coupled with Axiom Data Science’s working relationship with the IOOS Regional Association partners, will help ensure that this gap in functionality is closed and that the new features are communicated to potential users efficiently. We hope COMT will help bring this long-needed functionality to the IOOS community.</p>"

            "model_desc": "<h3>WCOFS:</h3><p>The objective of the WCOFS project is to develop a state-of-the-science operational coastal ocean circulation data assimilation (DA) and forecast system for the entire U.S. West Coast, providing daily updates of 3-day forecasts of shelf currents, temperature, sea level and other variables in support of many societally-relevant needs, including navigation, search and rescue, environmental hazard response, fisheries, and public health. The model, based on the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS), spans coastal waters to about 1,000 km offshore of the Pacific coast of North America, from 24N (mid Baja California, Mexico) to 55N (north of Vancouver Island, Canada). The model’s horizontal resolution is 2 km. Atmospheric forcing is obtained from the 12-km resolution NOAA North American Model (NAM) forecast model. Boundary conditions are provided by the 1/12th-degree NOAA Real-Time Ocean Forecast System (RTOFS) global model, with tides added along open boundaries. The model includes freshwater discharge from several major rivers in the Pacific Northwest (PNW). The skill of the non-DA model has been assessed using a 6-year run and observations of sea level from coastal gauges, HF RADAR surface currents, ARGO float temperature (T) and salinity (S) profiles, surface T from buoys, satellite sea-surface temperature (SST), and glider T and S sections (Kurapov et al., 2017a,b). The non-DA model has been transitioned to operational implementation at the NOAA/NOS/CO-OPS and is being run on a supercomputer at NOAA’s National Center for Environmental Prediction (NOAA/NCEP). The WCOFS’ DA component, currently in operational implementation testing at NOS/CO-OPS, uses a coarser 4-km resolution grid, with interpolation to the model’s 2-km grid, due to the heavy computational burden of DA. The WCOFS DA system will utilize ROMS 4D-Var and assimilate observations of HF RADAR surface currents, sea-level anomaly from satellite altimeters, and SST to improve forecast accuracy of currents and SST fronts. The goals are (a) to enhance the WCOFS system and (b) to evaluate and use WCOFS output for established needs of three adjacent RAs.</p><p><h3>Data Assimilation</h3><p>DA, a critical component of analysis and forecast systems in operational numerical weather prediction (NWP), is now a mainstay in many operational centers for the ocean as well. Most operational centers that run global ocean analysis and forecast systems, including federal agencies and intergovernmental organizations, employ a variety of DA approaches: ensemble optimal interpolation, ensemble Kalman filters (EnKF), and 3-dimensional variational (3D-Var) methods (Martin et al., 2015). Ocean analysis and forecast systems are also run at regional scales (Edwards et al., 2015) with many near real-time examples run routinely by IOOS RAs (Kourafalou et al., 2015; Oke et al., 2015). With computational demands for regional systems typically being less than for global systems, employed DA methods range from 3D-Var, to EnKF to 4D-Var methods.</p><p>DA is also a critical component of WCOFS, in terms of 1) producing the best possible analyses as a synthesis of the model and all available observations and 2) producing the best starting point for forecasts. During the last decade Team Member Moore has led development of a state-of-the-science 4D-Var DA system for the ROMS community (Moore et al., 2011a,b,c). The ROMS 4D-Var system has been used in many regions of the world’s oceans (e.g., the Indian Ocean, the Philippine Sea, the Santos Basin, the Tyrrhenian Sea, the Gulf of Alaska, the Intra-Americas Sea, the entire North Atlantic, the Norwegian Sea, the East Australia Current) and, perhaps most extensively, along the U.S. West Coast (e.g., Broquet et al., 2009, 2010; Moore et al., 2013; Neveu et al., 2016). In addition, ROMS 4D-Var is currently run within three RAs (CeNCOOS, MARACOOS, and PacIOOS) in near-real time in support of IOOS. Because WCOFS employs the community version of ROMS, it too uses this advanced 4D-Var system.</p><p>At U.C. Santa Cruz (UCSC), a regional ocean analysis and forecast system has been developed and, since 2011, has run every day in support of CeNCOOS to produce near real-time, publicly available ocean state estimates (http://oceanmodeling.ucsc.edu). Though spanning a smaller geographic domain than WCOFS and run at significantly lower horizontal resolution (~10 km), analyses (1980 to the present), produced by the CeNCOOS 4D-Var system have proved to be a very valuable community resource. These analyses are used in a wide variety of studies, ranging from climate variability (Crawford et al., 2017), to juvenile rockfish recruitment (Schroeder et al., 2015), and to marine mammal migration patterns (Becker et al., 2017). As part of this project, technical advances that exist within the CeNCOOS 4D-Var system (UCSC ROMS) but not in the WCOFS 4D-Var system will be transitioned to WCOFS.</p><h3>Biogeochemical Modeling</h3><p>Although physical ocean models provide critical information for temperature, salinity, transport and mixing, there exists considerable demand for non-physical oceanographic information as well. Expert panels within the Global Ocean Observing System have defined one useful set of Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs; www.goosocean.org/eov) that include phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass and diversity, nutrients, inorganic carbon, particulate matter, and oxygen. In other advanced regional and global ocean analyses, lower trophic level BGC models are used to provide this complementary ecological information (Ciavatta et al., 2016; Jones et al., 2016; Ford et al., 2017).</p><p>For several years, CeNCOOS has supported BGC modeling within UCSC ROMS described above, first using a simple NPZD model then, more recently, the NEMURO ecosystem model (Kishi et al., 2007). The latter model performed well in the evaluation studies (Mattern et al., 2017a) and in those performed as part of the now expiring COMT 2013-2018 project. In its base form, NEMURO has 11-components, including nitrogen- and silicon-based nutrients, two phytoplankton size classes, and three zooplankton size classes. Plankton diversity allows representation of different communities, which vary in nature from diatom-dominated nearshore waters to predominantly smaller organisms found in more-oligotrophic offshore zones. Team Member Fiechter has enhanced the base NEMURO model to include dissolved inorganic carbon, alkalinity, and calcium carbonate (Fiechter et al., 2014) and, more recently, oxygen, based on the formulation in Fennel et al. (2006).</p><p>While considerable research effort has been spent over decades constructing and improving biogeochemical models (these efforts should and will continue), it is important to recognize that all models are necessarily imperfect, due to many unavoidable factors: uncertainties in initial conditions, boundary conditions, surface forcing, and model parameterizations. Consequently, unconstrained model output deviates from nature. As with physical fields, DA provides a rigorous approach to constrain biogeochemical model output using observations. Over the last five years, Team Member Edwards has led development of a ROMS 4D-Var DA system for BGC models (Song et al., 2012, 2016a,b,c), and our ability to perform BGC ocean state estimation constrained by satellite-derived chlorophyll using NEMURO is quite mature within the CeNCOOS domain (Mattern et al., 2017a, b). Furthermore, our procedure is robust, ready to assimilate other BGC variables as new data types (e.g., oxygen) become available.</p><p>The WCOFS project has long envisioned incorporating a BGC modeling capability to further support ecological forecasting applications, but, at present, does not have a BGC component. As part of this project, we will develop a WCOFS NEMURO system that produces multiple water column EOVs and make progress toward a WCOFS 4D-Var BGC ocean state estimate.</p><h3>California-Harmful Algae Risk Mapping (C-HARM)</h3><p>Domoic acid poisoning in marine mammal and bird populations, along with the threat of Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning in humans, is considered to be the leading harmful algal bloom (HAB) issue for much of the U.S. West Coast. A coherent approach to developing predictive capabilities for integrated environmental assessments, early warning systems, action plans, and mitigation strategies for these toxigenic Pseudo-nitzschia blooms was established at the West Coast Governors Alliance Harmful Algal Bloom Summit in 2009 (Lewitus et al., 2012) and then re-energized as part of NOAA’s Ecological Forecasting Roadmap.</p><p>In response to the call for a predictive HAB capability in California to better inform management decisions, Team Members Anderson and Kudela developed the C-HARM System to inform when and where toxic blooms occur. During Phase 1 of the NASA-funded C-HARM project, the team successfully generated and validated routine nowcast and forecast products in a pre-transitional demonstration of predictions of toxigenic Pseudo-nitzschia blooms and domoic acid along the central California coast. Statistical ecological models are driven by information from ocean model simulations, enhanced satellite imagery, and community (Cal-HABMAP)/marine mammal observations (Anderson et al. 2016). In the present C-HARM implementation, physical oceanographic information derives from a 3-km resolution, quasi-operational, 3D-Var DA model developed by Dr. Yi Chao that spans the entire California coast (CA ROMS; Li et al., 2008; Chao et al. 2017) and is provided, with support from CeNCOOS and SCCOOS, by a commercial operations provider (Remote Sensing Solutions, Inc.). Optical parameters required by the ecological models are retrieved and processed from satellite data (presently daily 1-km MODIS-Aqua data).</p><p>CeNCOOS has served as the C-HARM pre-operational decision-making environment, with everything from satellite data processing to product distribution implemented in-house. A close partnership has been established with NOAA’s NOS National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS) to test the new data product on developmental computers. The C-HARM application has now transitioned to a demonstration readiness level within the end-user domain, hosted on NOAA’s high-performance computing (HPC) cluster, the Supercomputer for Satellite Simulations and Data Assimilation Studies (SSEC). The C-HARM capability is currently migrating to operational implementation at the NOAA CoastWatch West Coast Regional Node in partnership with NOAA/NOS/NCCOS.</p><p>As part of this project, we will initially evaluate C-HARM using historical WCOFS output and, if promising, will transition the end-to-end system at NOAA CoastWatch to using the operational WCOFS for its forecast product (See DiGiacomo LOS and Garfield LOS).</p><h3>Habitat Modeling Background</h3><p>NOAA’s National Marine Fisheries Service West Coast Regional Office (NMFS/WCRO), which is responsible for implementing U.S. West Coast fisheries management, is tasked with simultaneously maintaining target species catch at sustainable levels, reducing bycatch of protected and non-target species, and supporting the economic health of a fishery. Balancing these multiple and often opposing objectives is a complex management problem. For example, the California Drift Gillnet fishery (DGN) primarily targets broadbill swordfish (Xiphias gladius) in Federal waters off California, but bycatch of endangered species, such as the North Pacific loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea) turtles, have resulted in large-scale fishery closures that are enacted seasonally (leatherback turtles) and for June-August when an El Niño event is occurring or forecast to occur (loggerhead turtles). In making these decisions, the Pacific Fisheries Management Council (PFMC) and the NOAA/NMFS Southwest Regional Office are currently forced to consider coarse, often single-species, management approaches, without considering why interactions occurred where they did or where interactions are likely to occur in the future. Additionally, they are unable to consider whether this closure would increase bycatch of other species due to relocated fishing effort or the effects of the closure on fishers’ livelihoods. These missing considerations are not a result of the PFMC or NMFS lack of desire to explicitly consider these components; rather, they lack the tools to consider all of these pieces holistically.</p><p>Through projects previously and currently funded by NOAA and NASA, Team Member Hazen and collaborators have been developing a tool (EcoCast) to inform decision-makers for improved management strategies for the DGN fishery. EcoCast is based on statistical species distribution models (SDMs) developed for a number of swordfish fishery target and bycatch species of interest. These models, constructed using boosted regression trees (BRTs; Redfern et al. 2006, Wood 2008), describe the preferred habitats of target and bycatch species by statistically relating fisheries data (observer, satellite tracking, and logbook data) to concurrent oceanographic data. Target catch and bycatch SDMs are then normalized according to management risk and merged to create a single EcoCast product that predicts the relative probability of target catch and bycatch across the fishery landscape. A swordfish SDM has already been developed using the above approach (Scales et al., 2017) and a manuscript describing the EcoCast tool is now in review (Hazen et al., in review).</p><p>At present, EcoCast statistical models use either remotely-sensed data or output from the CeNCOOS-supported UCSC 4D-Var system. As part of this project, we will evaluate EcoCast’s relative performance when using WCOFS output versus the other sources presently in use.</p><h4>References</h4><p>Anderson C.R., R.M. Kudela, M.

NOAA’s National Ocean Service, Coast Survey Development Laboratory (CSDL) is developing the West Coast Ocean Forecasting System (WCOFS), a high-resolution ocean model spanning coastal and offshore waters relevant to all three RAs. The WCOF’s first implementation is presently in transition to operations within the National Ocean Service Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services. The goals of this project are (1) to advance coastal ocean modeling, analysis, and prediction through enhancements to the WCOFS model and (2) to transition established products relevant to NOAA’s Ecological Forecasting Roadmap to using WCOFS output. The vision is an advanced, operational, federal ocean model for the U.S. West Coast that supports locally generated, regionally relevant derivative ocean products required by end-users.</p><p>We propose several objectives for achieving these goals and contributing to this overall vision. This project will:</p><p>(a) assess WCOFS output using RA-developed metrics,</p><p>b) contribute specific technical developments to the WCOFS data assimilation implementation,</p><p>(c) couple WCOFS to a lower-trophic level, biogeochemical model with phytoplankton and zooplankton diversity and oxygen as state variables, transition a mature Harmful Algal Bloom (HAB) probability model to produce 3-day forecasts using WCOFS output, and</p><p>(d) evaluate WCOFS output for use in a fast, efficient habitat model for swordfish and protected species bycatch.</p><p>To facilitate transition to operations, around the end of each Project Year we will hold workshops with key CSDL personnel to communicate technical details and assist in issues arising from implementation. To maximize product value (research to applications), we will organize a stakeholder outreach meeting early in the project to discuss WCOFS-related products with end-users, receive feedback, and enable modifications to implementation plans.<p/><p>Specific benefits of the improved WCOFS implementation include short-term operational HAB predictions across large swaths of the U.S. west coast and dynamic swordfish species and bycatch maps. These products benefit stakeholders within three IOOS RAs, including marine mammal rescue organizations, shellfish growers, and fisheries and coastal resource managers. The improved ocean state estimates will have potentially broad future impacts for a host of other societal needs, including navigation, search and rescue, and environmental hazard response.</p>"

It includes major port cities such as Vancouver, Seattle, Tacoma, Bellingham, Port Angeles and Victoria, but does not currently have an OFS. The focus of the University of Washington (UW) ROMS based model of the Salish Sea and associated studies has primarily been on the Pacific Northwest coastal shelf away from inner Salish Sea waters (Sutherland et al. 2011, Giddings et al., 2014; Davis et al., 2014; and Siedlecki et al., 2015). To resolve the inter-basin hydrodynamics, exchange, and biogeochemical response to nutrient pollution from over 100 wastewater outfalls and numerous non-point sources in the inner waters of the Salish Sea, PNNL, in collaboration with Ecology, developed an externally coupled hydrodynamic and biogeochemical model of the entire Salish Sea (Khangaonkar et al., 2011a; 2012). The model was constructed using the unstructured grid Finite Volume Community Ocean model (FVCOM; Chen et al., 2003) framework and integrated-compartment model biogeochemical water-quality kinetics (CE-QUAL-ICM; Cerco and Cole, 1994; 1995). Since then, the Salish Sea Model grid has been expanded to include coastal waters around Vancouver Island and the continental shelf from Canada’s Queen Charlotte Strait to Oregon’s Waldport (south of Yaquina Bay) and includes the Columbia River estuary (Khangaonkar et al. 2017). The model now also includes a carbonate chemistry module for ocean acidification and a sediment diagenesis module which allows direct coupled interaction between the water column and sediments through the processes of organic sediment settling, burial, and remineralization (Pelletier et al., 2017; Bianucci et al., 2018).</p><p>With the aid of above improvements and a detailed recalibration effort using data from 2014, the observed residual exchange flows and biogeochemical conditions of the Salish Sea including near-bed hypoxia have been reproduced successfully (Khangaonkar et al 2017b, 2018). Researchers from various state and federal agencies, engaged in efforts related to restoration of the Salish Sea and management of the coastal ecosystem utilize SSM extensively in a diagnostic mode as part of pollution management, coastal restoration and land-use, and other nearshore feasibility assessments. Based on its current use and status, and the COMT RL ontology (NOAA Administrative Order 215-105B), the SSM is at RL5. Availability of the extensive current survey data of Puget Sound completed by NOAA in 2017 facilitates this transition effort from RL5 to RL7 with robust testing using the new data.</p><h4>References</h4><p><a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1525/elementa.151\">Bianucci, L., Long, W., Khangaonkar, T., Pelletier, G., Ahmed, A., Mohamedali, T., Roberts, M. and Figueroa-Kaminsky, C., 2018.

                "text": "<p>The NOAA/NOS has identified the Salish Sea region of Pacific Northwest as a major data gap for NOS. Development of an OFS for the Salish Sea has become a higher priority as a result of heightened community-wide interest in real-time oceanographic information. In addition to NOAA mission goals and priorities related to navigation, the increased risk of oil spills due to an unanticipated spike in tanker traffic in the region, impacting NOAA and U.S. Coast Guard maritime emergency response, is of major concern. Also, annually recurring hypoxic events, exposure of shellfish farms to corrosive waters, seasonal harmful algal blooms, occurrences of shellfish poisoning, and exposure to over 100 wastewater plumes, are ecosystem management related challenges faced by the community that need and would benefit from information from this Salish Sea estuarine circulation model.</p><p>A diagnostic hydrodynamic and biogeochemical model (nutrients, phytoplankton, carbon, dissolved oxygen, pH) of the Salish Sea has already been developed and tested with the ability to simulate characteristic circulation and water quality features. The performance of the model to reproduce known circulation features within the Salish Sea, respond to land-based and oceanic nutrient loads to reproduce observed algal cycles and hypoxia and simulate sediment diagenesis processes and coupling to the water column has been documented. The Salish Sea Model (SSM) is used by state and local agencies responsible for the management of water quality and the ecosystems in Puget Sound and the greater Salish Sea for the analysis of circulation, water quality, and ecosystem response; and for nutrient pollution management, sea level rise, climate change, and ocean acidification.</p><p>The objective of the proposed scope of work is to incorporate improvements and conduct robust testing of the SSM for transition to NOS. The work scope and approach has been developed with the expectation that following completion of testing, SSM-OFS will be transitioned to CO-OPS for future maintenance and operation. Specifically, the following activities are proposed towards completion of the readiness levels and transitioning of SSM.</p>"
